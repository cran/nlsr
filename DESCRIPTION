Description: Provides tools for working with nonlinear least squares problems.
      It is intended to eventually supersede the 'nls()' function in the R
      distribution. For example, 'nls()' specifically does NOT deal with small 
      or zero residual problems as its Gauss-Newton method frequently stops with
      'singular gradient' messages. 'nlsr' is based on the now-deprecated package
      'nlmrt', and has refactored functions and R-language symbolic derivative
      features.
